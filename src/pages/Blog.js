                    <p>In today’s <a href='#' class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">digital</a> age, the role of a web developer is pivotal. But what exactly does a web developer do, and why is their role so crucial in shaping the online world? This comprehensive guide delves into the intricacies of web development, exploring what web developers do, the skills they need, and how they contribute to creating the websites and web applications we use every day.</p>
                    <h1 class="text-gray-800 text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">Understanding the Role of a Web Developer</h1>
                    <p class="mt-2">At its core, a web developer is responsible for designing, building, and maintaining websites and web applications. They transform concepts and designs into functional websites, ensuring that they are not only visually appealing but also functional, efficient, and user-friendly. The work of a web developer involves a blend of technical and creative skills, making it a dynamic and versatile profession.</p>
                    <h1 class="text-gray-800 text-2xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-3">Types of Web Developers</h1>
                    <span class="text-gray-800 text-m font-semibold">Web developers can be broadly categorized into three main types, each with a distinct focus:</span>
                    <li class="list-decimal text-gray-800 text-m font-medium mt-3"><b>Front-End Developers:</b> Also known as client-side developers, front-end developers are responsible for what users see and interact with on a website. They use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the layout, design, and interactive elements of a site. Their goal is to ensure that the user experience (UX) is smooth, engaging, and intuitive.</li>

                param={`
                    <p class="font-semibold text-[18px]">At least 19 people have been killed in an overnight Israeli strike in the designated humanitarian zone in southern Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3 text-[19px]">Witnesses said the strike obliterated an area crowded with tents for displaced Palestinians in al-Mawasi, south-west of Khan Younis, leaving huge craters in the sand.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3 text-[19px]">The bombing was incredibly intense. People were thrown into the air, one displaced man told the BBC. You can't imagine the devastation.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3 text-[19px]">The Israeli military said its aircraft attacked what it called a number of senior Hamas terrorists operating there - a claim Hamas denied.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3 text-[19px]">The military also disputed the initial death toll put out by the Hamas-run Civil Defence authority, which reported that rescue teams had recovered more than 40 bodies.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3 text-[19px]">Hundreds of thousands of people have sought shelter in the humanitarian zone - which spans only about 41 sq km (16 sq miles) along Gaza's southern Mediterranean coast - after being told by the Israeli military to evacuate there for their own safety over the past 11 months.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3 text-[19px]">Living conditions inside the area are dire. The UN says it lacks critical infrastructure and basic services, while aid provision is limited due to access and security issues.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3 text-[19px]">Eyewitnesses said large explosions rocked al-Mawasi shortly after midnight local time on Tuesday (21:00 GMT on Monday).</p>
                    <p class="mt-3 text-[19px]">Khaled Mahmoud, a volunteer for a charity who lives near the site of the strike, told the BBC that he had been stunned by the scale of the destruction. The strikes created three craters 7m [23ft] deep and buried more than 20 tents, he said.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3 text-[19px]">Aya Madi, a displaced mother of seven from the southern city of Rafah, told a freelance journalist working for the BBC: “We woke up to nothing but sand and fire.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3 text-[19px]">My children were screaming, and the tent collapsed on them. I pulled them out from under the rubble. I held my two-month-old son, thinking he was dead, covered in sand, barely breathing. I washed him and thanked God he was still alive.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3 text-[19px]">She said all of those killed were civilians, adding that there was not a single resistance fighter. All that remains is dust and ashes, she added. Some of [the casualties] were torn in parts, other they had to dig to find, some were found in people's houses. The scene is terrifying.</p>
